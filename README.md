# dsp-signal-processing-project
Digital Signal Processing project: analysis of a noisy signal, DFT exploration, system correction, and design of a notch + low-pass filter.

This project focuses on analyzing and processing a sampled signal using Digital Signal Processing (DSP) techniques.

The project includes:

Loading and visualizing a noisy signal

Time-domain and frequency-domain analysis (DFT)

Modeling and correcting a distorting system

Designing and implementing a notch filter

Designing a low-pass filter and evaluating results

Implementing everything in Python

The sampling frequency used in this project is 60,000 Hz.
